## ramp up

Create a new feature branch with git worktrees for all repositories

### Synopsis

Create a new feature branch by creating git worktrees for all repositories
from their configured locations. This creates isolated working directories for each repo
in the trees/<feature-name>/ directory.

By default, new feature branches are created from the default branch. Use the --target
flag to create the feature from a different source:
  - Existing feature name: ramp up new-feature --target my-existing-feature
  - Local branch name: ramp up new-feature --target feature/my-branch
  - Remote branch name: ramp up new-feature --target origin/feature/my-branch

Use the --from flag to create from a remote branch with automatic naming:
  - Remote branch: ramp up --from claude/feature-123
    Creates trees/feature-123/ with branch claude/feature-123 from origin/claude/feature-123
  - Override name: ramp up my-name --from claude/feature-123
    Creates trees/my-name/ with branch claude/feature-123 from origin/claude/feature-123

The operation is atomic - if any step fails, all successful operations will be
rolled back to ensure no partial feature state remains.

After creating worktrees, runs any setup script specified in the configuration.

```
ramp up [feature-name] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --from string     Create from remote branch with automatic prefix/name derivation (mutually exclusive with --target, --prefix, --no-prefix)
  -h, --help            help for up
      --no-prefix       Disable branch prefix for this feature (mutually exclusive with --prefix)
      --no-refresh      Skip refresh for all repositories (overrides auto_refresh config)
      --prefix string   Override the branch prefix (defaults to config default_branch_prefix)
      --refresh         Force refresh all repositories before creating feature (overrides auto_refresh config)
      --target string   Create feature from existing feature name, local branch, or remote branch
```
