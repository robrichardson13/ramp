## ramp refresh

Update all source repositories by pulling changes from their remotes

### Synopsis

Update all source repositories by pulling changes from their remotes.

This command will:
1. Fetch all remotes for each configured repository
2. Pull changes if the current branch has a remote tracking branch
3. Report status for repositories without remote tracking branches

This is useful when the source repositories have been updated (either locally or remotely)
and you want to pull down the latest changes.
