## ramp

A CLI tool for managing multi-repo development workflows

### Synopsis

Ramp is a CLI tool that helps developers manage multi-repository projects
with git worktrees and automated setup scripts.

Getting started:
  ramp init     - Create new ramp project with interactive setup
  ramp install  - Clone configured repositories
  ramp up       - Create feature branch (auto-installs if needed)

Find a project directory with a .ramp/ramp.yaml configuration file and run
commands to manage repositories and create feature branches.

### Options

  -v, --verbose   Show detailed output during operations
```
