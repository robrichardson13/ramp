## ramp run

Run a custom command defined in the configuration

### Synopsis

Run a custom command defined in the ramp.yaml configuration.

If a feature name is provided, the command is executed from within that
feature's trees directory with access to feature-specific environment variables.

If no feature name is provided, ramp will attempt to auto-detect the feature
based on your current working directory. If not in a feature tree, the command
is executed from the source directory with access to source repository paths.

Arguments after -- are passed directly to the script as positional arguments
($1, $2, etc.) and also via the RAMP_ARGS environment variable.

Note: RAMP_ARGS is space-joined, so arguments containing spaces will lose
their boundaries. Use positional arguments ($1, $2, $@) for such cases.

Example:
  ramp run open my-feature    # Run 'open' command for 'my-feature'
  ramp run open               # Auto-detect feature from current directory
  ramp run deploy             # Run 'deploy' command against source repos
  ramp run check -- --cwd backend    # Pass args to the script
  ramp run test my-feature -- --all  # Feature name + args

```
ramp run <command-name> [feature-name] [-- args...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for run
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -v, --verbose   Show detailed output during operations
  -y, --yes       Non-interactive mode: skip prompts and auto-confirm
```
