## ramp run

Run a custom command defined in the configuration

### Synopsis

Run a custom command defined in the ramp.yaml configuration.

If a feature name is provided, the command is executed from within that
feature's trees directory with access to feature-specific environment variables.

If no feature name is provided, ramp will attempt to auto-detect the feature
based on your current working directory. If not in a feature tree, the command
is executed from the source directory with access to source repository paths.

Example:
  ramp run open my-feature    # Run 'open' command for 'my-feature'
  ramp run open               # Auto-detect feature from current directory
  ramp run deploy             # Run 'deploy' command against source repos

```
ramp run <command-name> [feature-name] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for run
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -v, --verbose   Show detailed output during operations
```
