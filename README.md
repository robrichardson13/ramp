# Ramp

**Work on features across multiple repositories simultaneously using git worktrees and automated workflows.**

```bash
ramp init          # Initialize multi-repo project
ramp up my-feature # Create feature branches across all repos
ramp status        # View all active features
ramp down my-feature # Clean up when done
```

## Why Ramp?

Modern applications span multiple repositories (microservices, frontend/backend, libraries). Ramp automates the entire development workflow:

- 🚀 **One command setup** - Create branches across all repos simultaneously
- 🔄 **Git worktrees** - Work on multiple features in parallel without branch switching
- 🎯 **Port management** - Automatic port allocation prevents conflicts
- 📦 **Environment automation** - Custom scripts handle dependencies and services
- 🧹 **Batch cleanup** - Remove all merged features with `ramp prune`

## Quick Start

### Install

**Homebrew** (macOS/Linux):
```bash
brew install freedomforeversolar/tools/ramp
```

**Pre-built binaries**: Download from [releases](https://github.com/FreedomForeverSolar/ramp/releases)

**From source**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FreedomForeverSolar/ramp.git
cd ramp
go build -o ramp .
./install.sh
```

### Auto-Updates

**Homebrew installs automatically stay up-to-date** 🎉

When installed via Homebrew, ramp automatically updates itself in the background whenever new versions are released. Updates happen silently while you work—you'll always have the latest features and fixes without lifting a finger.

**Configuration** (`~/.ramp/settings.yaml`):
```yaml
auto_update:
  enabled: true      # Set to false to disable
  check_interval: 12h  # How often to check (default: 12h)
```

The settings file is auto-created on first run. Edit it anytime to customize auto-update behavior.

**Manual installs** (from source or pre-built binaries) don't auto-update—you'll need to manually pull updates or reinstall when you want to upgrade.

### Try the Demo

```bash
cd demo/demo-microservices-app
ramp install      # Clone demo repositories
ramp up my-feature # Create feature across all repos
ramp status       # View status
ramp down my-feature # Clean up
```

### Create Your Project

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
ramp init         # Interactive setup
ramp up my-feature # Start coding!
```

## Desktop App

Prefer a GUI? The Ramp desktop app provides a visual interface for managing your multi-repo projects with real-time progress updates, one-click feature creation, and custom command execution.

## How It Works

Ramp creates isolated workspaces for each feature using git worktrees:

```
my-project/
├── .gitignore          # Auto-generated (ignores repos/, trees/, local config)
├── .ramp/
│   └── ramp.yaml       # Configuration
├── repos/              # Main repository clones (gitignored)
│   ├── frontend/
│   └── api/
└── trees/              # Feature workspaces (gitignored, where you work)
    ├── feature-a/
    │   ├── frontend/   # Worktree on branch feature/feature-a
    │   └── api/        # Worktree on branch feature/feature-a
    └── feature-b/
        ├── frontend/
        └── api/
```

Each feature gets:
- Dedicated branches in all repositories
- Isolated working directories (git worktrees)
- Unique port allocation
- Automated setup (install deps, start services, run migrations)
- Automated cleanup

## Core Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ramp init` | Initialize a new multi-repo project |
| `ramp install` | Clone all configured repositories |
| `ramp up <feature>` | Create feature branches across all repos |
| `ramp down <feature>` | Remove feature branches and cleanup |
| `ramp rename <feature> <name>` | Set a display name for a feature |
| `ramp prune` | Batch remove all merged features |
| `ramp status` | Show project status and active features |
| `ramp run <cmd>` | Run custom commands (dev, test, etc.) |

See [docs/commands/](docs/commands/) for detailed command reference.

## Configuration

Ramp uses `.ramp/ramp.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my-project

repos:
  - path: repos
    git: git@github.com:org/frontend.git
  - path: repos
    git: git@github.com:org/api.git

setup: scripts/setup.sh      # Run after 'ramp up'
cleanup: scripts/cleanup.sh  # Run before 'ramp down'

default-branch-prefix: feature/

base_port: 3000
max_ports: 200
ports_per_feature: 2  # Allocate 2 ports per feature

commands:
  - name: dev
    command: scripts/dev.sh
```

Scripts receive environment variables for automation:
- `RAMP_PORT` - Unique port for this feature
- `RAMP_TREES_DIR` - Feature workspace path
- `RAMP_DISPLAY_NAME` - Human-readable name (if set via `--name`)
- `RAMP_REPO_PATH_<NAME>` - Path to each repository

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for full reference.

## Example Setup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .ramp/scripts/setup.sh

# Install dependencies
cd "$RAMP_TREES_DIR/frontend"
npm install

cd "$RAMP_TREES_DIR/api"
npm install

# Start database on feature-specific port
docker run -d \
  --name "db-${RAMP_WORKTREE_NAME}" \
  -p "$RAMP_PORT_2:5432" \
  postgres:15

# Run migrations
cd "$RAMP_TREES_DIR/api"
npm run migrate

echo "✅ Ready! Run 'ramp run dev' to start"
```

## Use Cases

**Microservices Development**
Coordinate features across multiple services with shared databases and networking

**Frontend/Backend Projects**
Develop full-stack features requiring changes to both repos simultaneously

**Library Development**
Work on libraries alongside applications that consume them with live linking

**Multi-Environment Testing**
Set up isolated environments for testing features without affecting main development
